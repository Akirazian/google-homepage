# google-homepage
[A complete recreation of Google's homepage from scratch using CSS only](https://akirazian.github.io/google-homepage/)

I made this without checking the actual HTML/CSS code from Google. The only "cheat" I used was a browser extension to detect the correct CSS color codes. A lot of trial and error but it paid off!
